# ðŸ—‘ðŸ§¹ Cleaning Up Starter Code

## User Story

As marketing agency it's important to have a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that it can more effectively utilize Search Engine Optimization and so that the webpage can be useful to viewers who use a screen reader. 

It's also important that the structure of the code follows a logical flow and is easy to read and understand on the backend so any future developers who want to change anything can do so easily and efficiently.
